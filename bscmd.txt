‚öôÔ∏è 1Ô∏è‚É£ ping
Purpose:
Used to check connectivity between your system and another host (e.g., a website or IP).
Syntax:
ping <hostname or IP address>
Example:
ping google.com
Explanation:
Sends ICMP Echo Requests and waits for Echo Replies.
Shows packet loss, time delay (latency), and confirms network connection.
Press Ctrl + C to stop.


‚öôÔ∏è 2Ô∏è‚É£ traceroute
Purpose:
Shows the path (route) packets take from your system to a destination host.
Syntax:
traceroute <hostname or IP>
Example:
traceroute google.com
Explanation:
Displays each hop (router) along the way.
Helps find network delays or where connection breaks.
Each line = one router between your system and target.

‚öôÔ∏è 3Ô∏è‚É£ nslookup
Purpose:
Queries the DNS (Domain Name System) to find the IP address of a domain name.
Syntax:
nslookup <domain name>
Example:
nslookup google.com
Explanation:
Shows the IP address corresponding to a domain name.
You can also do reverse lookup (IP ‚Üí Domain).

‚öôÔ∏è 4Ô∏è‚É£ netstat
Purpose:
Displays network connections, routing tables, and interface statistics.
Syntax:
netstat -a
Common Options:
-a ‚Üí Show all connections
-t ‚Üí TCP connections only
-u ‚Üí UDP connections only
-n ‚Üí Show numeric addresses
-r ‚Üí Display routing table
Example:
netstat -tuln
Explanation:
Lists active ports and services.
Useful for checking which ports are open and what services are running.
‚öôÔ∏è 5Ô∏è‚É£ arp
Purpose:
Displays and modifies the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) table.
Syntax:
arp -n
Example:
arp -a
Explanation:
ARP maps IP addresses to MAC addresses.
Shows list of known devices on the local network.
‚öôÔ∏è 6Ô∏è‚É£ rarp (Reverse ARP)

Purpose:
Used to find the IP address of a machine from its MAC address (rarely used now).
Command Example:
rarp -a
Explanation:Opposite of ARP.
Mostly replaced by DHCP in modern networks.
‚öôÔ∏è 7Ô∏è‚É£ ip

Purpose:
Modern replacement for many old commands (ifconfig, route, etc.)
Used to configure network interfaces, routing, and IP addresses.

Syntax & Examples:

ip addr show
ip link show
ip route show


Explanation:
ip addr show ‚Üí shows all IP addresses assigned
ip route show ‚Üí displays routing table
ip link set eth0 up ‚Üí enable interface eth0.

‚öôÔ∏è 8Ô∏è‚É£ ifconfig

Purpose:
Used to view and configure network interface parameters (older tool, replaced by ip).

Syntax:
ifconfig
Example:
ifconfig eth0


Explanation:

Shows IP address, MAC address, MTU, RX/TX packets, etc.

Can also be used to bring interfaces up/down.


‚öôÔ∏è 9Ô∏è‚É£ dig

Purpose:
Performs detailed DNS lookups (Domain Information Groper).

Syntax:

dig <domain name>


Example:

dig google.com


Explanation:

Provides detailed DNS info like IP, MX records, TTL, etc.


‚öôÔ∏è üîü route

Purpose:
Displays or modifies the IP routing table.

Syntax:
route -n
Example:
route


Explanation:

Shows how packets are forwarded (gateway, destination, mask).

-n shows numeric IPs instead of domain names.

Modern alternative: ip route show.

Used for DNS troubleshooting
